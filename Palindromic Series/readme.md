# Palindromic Series

There are multiple palindrome-related problem on LeetCode, ranging from easier ones to harder ones. It is interesting to solve these problems and see how one problem is different from the others. 

This section introduces some of the most common problems on the palindromic series and highlights the differences among these problems in their concept, sizes, and complexity. 

## Problems

* Check if a string is a palindrome
* Longest Palindromic Substring ([LeetCode Problem #5](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/))
* Longest Palindromic Subssequence [LeetCode Problem #516](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/))
