# Problem
[438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

Given a string `s` and a non-empty string `p`, find all the start indices of (pattern) `p`'s anagrams in `s`.

Input: `s`: "abab" `p`: "ab"
Output: [0, 1, 2]

# Algorithms:
##### Use sliding window with two pointers (start,end) to evaluate whether the value of substring in s matches the pattern `p`

There are a few options to store pattern `p`:
* Create a dictionary with (key,val) = (char, count) with char in s
* Vectorize pattern `p` with a long vector of 1x26 (26 is the number of lowercase English letter

# Code
### Dictionary
```
class Solution(object):
    def findAnagrams(self, s, p):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type p: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(p) > len(s): return []
        
        from collections import Counter
        counterP = Counter(p)
        
        ans = []
        for start in range(len(s)-len(p)+1):
            end = start+len(p)
            counterS = Counter(s[start:end])
            if counterS == counterP:
                ans.append(start)
        return ans
                
```

### Vectorize

```
class Solution(object):
    def findAnagrams(self, s, p):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type p: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(p) > len(s): return []
        
        pVec, temp = [0] *26, [0] *26
        ans = []
        
        #vectorize p
        for c in p:
            pVec[ord(c)-ord('a')] += 1
        # vectorize temporary value of the first string of len(p) in s, starting with index 0
        for c in s[:len(p)]:
            temp[ord(c)-ord('a')] += 1
            
        if temp == pVec: ans.append(0)
        
        #update temp
        for end in range(len(p), len(s)):
            temp[ord(s[end]) - ord('a')] +=1
            temp[ord(s[end-len(p)]) - ord('a')] -=1
            if temp == pVec:
                ans.append(end-len(p)+1) #append start index
        return ans
   ```

# Things I Learn from this Exercise:
- Sliding Window with two pointers (start,end) is effective in problems concerning a substring/sub-list with fixed length 
- Vectorization is more flexible for updating a temp memory to do the next operations (in this case, the operation is comparison). It is possible to update the `counterS` temp dictionary to compare with `counterP`; however, this update is more complicated.
- For a problem where the characteristics of the input data enable a dimensionality reduction opportunity, think of vectorization. In this problem, the data is limited to "English letter in lowercase", which reduces the dimension of the vector size to length of 26.
