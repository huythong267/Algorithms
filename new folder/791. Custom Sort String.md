# Problem
[791. Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/)

This problem essentially gives a reference `S` and a new string `T`. You are asked to sort the new string `T` according to its custom order in `S` 

Input:
`S` = "cba"
`T` = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"

# Algorithms
* Create a dictionary of (key, val) corresponding to the (character, index) in S 
* Custom sort the new string with this dictionary

# Code

```
ref = {}
for i, char in enumerate(S):
    ref[char] = i

ans = [c for c in T if c in ref.keys()]
ans.sort(key = lambda x: ref[x])
ans += [c for c in T if c not in ref.keys()]

return ''.join(ans)
```
