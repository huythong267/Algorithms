# Task:

1.	From array, tell what operation on array that the code tries to calculate (max sum of sub-array, print out all the subsequence that has a fixed sum) – hundred of examples on LeetCode – just pick one that you like.
2.	Algorithm summary
3.	Show the code + running examples.
4.	Push to GitHub (sub folder, arrange topic later)


# Example:
1. Problem: Decoder: Number to String
- ‘123’ to ??
- ‘1’+’23’ to A, X
- ’12’+ ‘3’ to M, C
- String (‘ABC’) to (1)

2. Algorithm: 
-	Dfs divide num (1,23), (1,2,3), (1,23)
-	Map from valid num to string 

3. Code:

4. Test code on LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/

5. Further Discussions
- Smaller problem
- Extend the concept to solve a more generalized problem
- Comparison: how this problem differs, similar, etc. to other problems that you've done.
