[310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/)

For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

Format
The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Example 1 :

Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

        0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3 

Output: [1]
Example 2 :

Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

     0  1  2
      \ | /
        3
        |
        4
        |
        5 

Output: [3, 4]

# Algorithm
In this problem, the edges between nodes are undirected: if node A is connected to node B, node B is also connected to node A. Inflow degree of A is the length of `graph[nodeA]`. 

```
graph = {node:set() for node in range(n)}
inflow_degree = {node: 0 for node in range(n)}
for node, nxt in edges:
    graph[node].add(nxt)
    graph[nxt].add(node)

for node in inflow_degree:
    inflow_degree[node] = len(graph[node])
```

It is also noticeable that the Minimum Height Tree can have at most two nodes. Thus, we will gradually remove leaves and related edges until there are only 1/2 leaves left in the trees and return the last nodes..

```
remaining = set([node for node in inflow_degree])
while len(remaining) >2:
    leaves = set([nxt for nxt in remaining if len(graph[nxt])== 1]) # pop out all leaves
    for leaf in leaves:
        nodes = graph[leaf]
        for node in nodes:
            graph[node].remove(leaf)
    remaining -= leaves

return remaining
```

# Code

    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n, edges):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type edges: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        graph = {node:set() for node in range(n)}
        inflow_degree = {node: 0 for node in range(n)}
        for node, nxt in edges:
            graph[node].add(nxt)
            graph[nxt].add(node)
            
        for node in inflow_degree:
            inflow_degree[node] = len(graph[node])
            
        remaining = set([node for node in inflow_degree])
        while len(remaining) >2:
            leaves = set([nxt for nxt in remaining if len(graph[nxt])== 1]) # pop out all leaves
            for leaf in leaves:
                nodes = graph[leaf]
                for node in nodes:
                    graph[node].remove(leaf)
            remaining -= leaves
        
        return remaining

# Further Discussions

#### Similarity and differences between this problem and [207. Course Schedule](https://github.com/trang-nguyenn/Algorithms/blob/master/LeetCode/207.%20Course%20Schedule.md)
* Similarity: use leaves removing technique to gradually go through all the leaves and nodes
* Differences: 
1. The graph in this problem is undirected while the graph in Problem 207 is directed.
2. In this problem, we observe that the minimum trees should have at most 2 nodes. Thus, we will go through all the nodes until the remaining nodes are less than or equal to 2. In Problem 207, we started with the first node and expand the network until we cannot go further.
